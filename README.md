Welcome to GameRecon: the focus of this online website it to give users the freedom of finding important information about any Steam video game they might be interested in.\
Program uses web scraping to retrieve the relationship between the gameâ€™s names and their ID numbers.\
By creating a relationship, we can search ether by name or number for a specific game and use their ID numbers to send an API request to Steam for specific information.\
Information retrieved include: Artwork for game title, Game Name, Game Rating, Players Online, Total Positive Reviews, Parental Warnings, Total Negative Review, APP Type, App ID, Most Recent Helpful Reviews, Rating for Game, Review Link for Metacritic and Steam community Link for game.\
There are provided two buttons at the end of the webpage that allow for a game description and a graph of the Concurrent players on steam over the last seven days.
